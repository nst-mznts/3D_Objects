# ðŸŒŒ 3D Objects Visualizer

## Description

This is a Three.js-based web application for visualizing interactive 3D objects in a retro wave-styled scene. It features a starry sky with round, static stars, a neon-gradient 3D mesh (e.g., torus knot, sphere, cube), and a control panel for customizing the scene. Users can switch shapes, change color presets, adjust scale, and toggle visibility, all rendered in a WebGL canvas with a synthwave aesthetic.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Scene**: Renders a starry sky with round, static stars and a neon-gradient 3D mesh using Three.js.
- **Control Panel**: Allows users to:
  - Switch between shapes (Torus Knot, Sphere, Cube).
  - Select color presets (Pink-Cyan, Purple-Blue, Green-Magenta).
  - Adjust the mesh scale with a slider.
  - Toggle mesh visibility.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Rotate the 3D mesh by moving the mouse.
